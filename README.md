## **Business Context**

Zomato operates in a highly competitive food delivery and restaurant aggregation market. Understanding who spends, how often, and why is critical to driving growth. The goal of this analysis is to identify the most **valuable user segments** and uncover opportunities to optimize engagement, retention, and revenue.

Using a dataset covering **user demographics, order frequency, and total sales**, this analysis aims to highlight patterns in spending behavior and provide **actionable recommendations** for Zomato’s customer strategy.

### **Business Challenges**

Zomato faces several key challenges related to **user segmentation and revenue optimization**:

1. **Identifying High-Value Users** – Who are the most valuable users, and how do they behave?
2. **Revenue Distribution Gaps** – Are there untapped or underperforming user segments?
3. **Retention & Order Frequency** – How can Zomato increase repeat orders and improve customer retention?

### **Key Questions**

1. Who are Zomato’s most valuable user segments?
2. How do demographic attributes influence revenue and spending patterns?
3. Where can Zomato capitalize on revenue and improve engagement?
4. What strategies can be used to increase order frequency and customer retention?
5. Are there any low-performing segments that should be deprioritized?

## **Approach**

To **systematically decompose** this problem, we structured our analysis into four phases:

1. **Data Exploration**
    - Understanding the structure of user, orders, and restaurant data.
    - Identifying relevant attributes: **demographics, spending patterns, and order frequency**.
2. **Segmentation Analysis**
    - Clustering users based on **age, marital status, occupation, and income level**.
    - Identifying which groups contribute **disproportionately** to revenue.
3. **Revenue & Retention Insights**
    - Analyzing **spending behaviors** across different segments.
    - Identifying trends in **repeat purchases, average order value (AOV), and sales concentration**.
4. **Strategic Recommendations**
    - Developing actionable insights for **marketing, engagement, and retention strategies**.

## **Key Insights**

1. **Single students dominate revenue** – Despite reporting no income, postgraduate and graduate students are among the **highest spenders**, likely due to family financial support or lifestyle preferences.
2. **Order frequency is the key driver of revenue** – Segments with **higher repeat purchases** consistently outperform others. Increasing order frequency should be a primary retention focus.
3. **Marital status & occupation significantly impact spending** – Single users and students contribute the majority of transactions, whereas **married individuals and older users** tend to have **lower order frequency**.
4. **High-value segments exist within low-income groups** – Some **low-income users** exhibit strong spending patterns, indicating potential for **targeted engagement** rather than assuming income alone determines spending.
5. **Targeted marketing can drive stronger retention** – With clear segment identification, Zomato can implement **personalized promotions, loyalty programs, and re-engagement strategies** to maximize revenue from its **most valuable users**.
